- 👋 Hi, I’m @TheDocGuy, also known as Ryan Lake. I'm a technical writer with seven years of experience evenly split between SaaS and robotics for manufacturing. I’m currently in my third year managing a globally distributed team of writers.
- 👀 I’m interested in product and project management certifications, improving team collaboration using tools like Azure DevOps, Microsoft Teams, and MadCap Flare, and exploring organizational change management. I'm also passionate about knowledge sharing and professional development for writers.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning advanced team leadership, program management, and automation workflows with tools like Microsoft Power Automate and Azure DevOps. In 2025, I’m looking to expand into static site generators and further advocate for sustainable documentation and communication practices that drive great outcomes through effective efforts.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on improving technical documentation processes, exploring new use cases for document automation, creating robust workflows for continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipelines, and gaining experience in program management.
- 📫 How to reach me: Connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/) or via GitHub messages.
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him
- ⚡ Fun fact: When I’m not leading documentation initiatives, I enjoy exploring barefoot shoes, planning remote work trips, or developing creative ways to use AI to improve meeting management.
